This repository contains the source code for [Rocket Rescue Node](https://rescuenode.com),
a community-run, trust-minimized, and secured fallback node for emergencies and maintenance.

This web app uses [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Reown](https://reown.com/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

# Local Dev

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

Run `npm run pretty` to normalize style before committing.

# Publishing

Run `npm run build` in your terminal. This will create a `dist/` directory with the compiled files.
